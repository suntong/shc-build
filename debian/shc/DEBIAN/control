Description: Generic shell script compiler
 shc creates a stripped binary executable from shell script.
 .
 shc encodes and encrypts a shell script and generates C source code with
 the added expiration capability. Its main purpose is to protect your shell
 scripts from modification or inspection.  You can use it if you wish to
 distribute your scripts but don't want them to be easily readable by other
 people or if you need to hide passwords.
